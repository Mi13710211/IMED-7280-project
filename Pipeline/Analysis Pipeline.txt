# Analysis Pipeline 

## Overview
This pipeline outlines the data data wrangling, differential expression analysis, regression modeling, and correlation analysis.


## 1. Input first Data
- Bulk RNA-seq count matrix from the GEO dataset (GSE255720).


## 2. Data Wrangling
- Change column names and remove unnecessary rows/columns.

- Filter out missing values in the gene_symbol column.

- Replace gene_symbol with ENSEMBL_ID.

- Set ENSEMBL_ID as row names. 

- Convert count data to integers.

- Remove genes with a total count lower than 10.

## 3. Differential B cell-related Genes

-  log2-transformation of count data

-create a heatmap for CD19, CD79A, CD79B, SDC1, and PTPRC accross the samples

## 4. Differential Expression Analysis Using DESeq2

- Define conditions:
  
- Run DESeq2:
  library(DESeq2)
  dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count, colData = coldata, design = ~condition)
  dds <- DESeq(dds)
  ```

## 5. GSEA and barplot

- Imported the sgnificant differential genes with ENSEMBL_ID

- Biological function analysis

-Select the description of gene sets related to the B cells

- Generate the barplot


## 6. Visualization: Volcano Plot of Ig expression
- Determin the constant region of Ig genes as the target genes

- Turn off other genes

-Generate the volcano plot

## 1. Input second Data
- Microarray expression matrix from GEO dataset (GSE206171).

## 2. Data Wrangling
- Change column names and remove unnecessary rows/columns.

- Filter out missing values in the gene_symbol column.

- Replace gene_symbol with ENSEMBL_ID.

- Set ENSEMBL_ID as row names. 

- Convert count data to integers.

- Remove genes with a total count lower than 10.

## 3. Differential Expression Analysis Using DESeq2

- Define conditions:
  
- Run DESeq2:
  library(DESeq2)
  dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count, colData = coldata, design = ~condition)
  dds <- DESeq(dds)
  ```

## 4. Visualization: Violin Plot of FDCSP Expression
- Extract and log-transform counts for `FDCSP (ENSG00000181617)`.

  ```

## 5. Regression Analysis: FDCSP and demographic information
- Convert FDCSP expression into binary (high vs. low)

- Extract Mayo score (disease severity) and FDCSP expression

 - Logistic Regression for disease duration and FDCSP expression

 ```
  
## 4. Correlation Analysis Between FDCSP, TNF-A, and B-Cell Markers
- Select genes for analysis:
 
- Compute correlation matrix:

- Generate heatmap
